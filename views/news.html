                            <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of
                                length:
                                a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc.

                                reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a
                                paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that
                                forms a
                                unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a
                                section in a
                                paper is a paragraph.</p>
